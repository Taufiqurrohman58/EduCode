  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/bghome.jpeg
    - assets/sounds/bg_music.mp3
    - assets/lottie/cat.json
    - assets/images/title.png
    - assets/images/logo.png
    - assets/svg/map_vertical.svg
    - assets/drawable/map_vertical.png
    - assets/images/snake.png

    - assets/images/fish.png
    - assets/images/lion.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: fredoka
      fonts:
      - asset: fonts/fredoka/Fredoka-Medium.ttf
      # - asset: fonts/fredoka/Fredoka-Italic.ttf
      #   style: italic
    - family: arimo
      fonts:
      - asset: fonts/arimo/Arimo-Medium.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
